### Task 7: Integrating API Data into the Application

**Objective:**

Integrate data from a provided API endpoint into your application and populate the cards with this fetched data.

**Steps:**

1. **Checkout API Endpoint:**
   - Navigate to the provided API endpoint.
   - Familiarize yourself with the structure of the data returned by the endpoint, including the fields and format.

2. **Fetch Data from Endpoint:**
   - Within your application, implement a function to fetch data from the API endpoint.
   - Use appropriate methods such as `fetch()` or libraries like Axios to make an HTTP request to the endpoint.
   - Ensure that the fetched data is an array of objects that you can use to populate the cards in the next step.

3. **Populate Cards with Fetched Data:**
   - Modify your application logic to replace the existing dummy data with the data fetched from the API endpoint.
   - Populate the cards in your application with the fetched data, ensuring that each card corresponds to an object in the array.
   - Display relevant information from the fetched data within each card, such as name, title, description, etc.

4. **Reach Out for Assistance:**
   - If you encounter any challenges while fetching or integrating the API data into your application, don't hesitate to reach out to your mentors for assistance.
